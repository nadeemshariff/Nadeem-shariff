// Understand and implement basic error handling using try-catch blocks.
// Use finally blocks to execute code regardless of the try-catch outcome.
// Create and use custom error classes.
// Handle errors in promises using .catch() and within async functions using try-catch.
// Implement graceful error handling when making network requests with the fetch API.

// Day 13: Modules

// Tasks/Activities

// Activity 1: Creating and Exporting Modules

// Task 1: Create a module that exports a function to add two numbers. Import and use this module in another script.
// Task 2: Create a module that exports an object representing a person with properties and methods. Import and use this module in another script.
// Activity 2: Named and Default Exports

// Task 3: Create a module that exports multiple functions using named exports. Import and use these functions in another script.
// Task 4: Create a module that exports a single function using default export. Import and use this function in another script.
// Activity 3: Importing Entire Modules

// Task 5: Create a module that exports multiple constants and functions. Import the entire module as an object in another script and use its properties.
// Activity 4: Using Third-Party Modules

// Task 6: Install a third-party module (e.g., lodash) using npm. Import and use a function from this module in a script.
// Task 7: Install a third-party module (e.g., axios) using npm. Import and use this module to make a network request in a script.
// Activity 5: Module Bundling (Optional)

// Task 8: Use a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file. Write a script to demonstrate the bundling process.
// Feature Request

// Basic Module Script: Write a script that creates a module exporting a function and imports it in another script.
// Named and Default Exports Script: Create a script demonstrating both named and default exports and their usage.
// Third-Party Module Script: Write a script that installs, imports, and uses functions from third-party modules like lodash and axios.
// Module Bundling Script: Create a script demonstrating how to bundle JavaScript files using a module bundler (optional).
// Achievement

// By the end of these activities, students will:

// Create and export functions, objects, and constants using modules.
// Import modules using named and default imports.
// Use third-party modules installed via npm.
// Understand the basics of module bundling (optional).
