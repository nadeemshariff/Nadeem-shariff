# Movie Search App Project

## Overview

This project is a movie search app that allows users to search for movies by title and display the movie title, poster, and release year on the web page. It also includes search functionality to fetch and display movie data based on a search query entered in the input field, and detailed information about selected movies can be displayed by clicking on the "More Info" button.

## Tasks/Activities

### Setting Up the Project

1. Initialize a new project directory and set up the basic HTML structure for the movie search app.
2. Add a basic CSS file to style the movie search app, including a container for displaying movie search results.

### Fetching Movie Data

1. Use the fetch API to get movie data from a public movie API (e.g., OMDB API or The Movie Database API). Log the response data to the console.
2. Parse the movie data and display the movie title, poster, and release year on the web page.

### Adding Search Functionality

1. Add an input field and a search button to the HTML structure. Style the input and button using CSS.
2. Write a function to fetch and display movie data based on a search query entered in the input field. Log any errors to the console.

### Displaying Detailed Movie Information

1. Modify the search results to include a "More Info" button for each movie. When clicked, fetch and display additional details about the movie, such as the plot, director, and actors.
2. Create a modal or a new section on the page to display the detailed movie information.

### Enhancing the UI

1. Add CSS styles to improve the layout and design of the search results and detailed movie information.
2. Add CSS animations or transitions to make the movie search app more interactive and visually appealing.
