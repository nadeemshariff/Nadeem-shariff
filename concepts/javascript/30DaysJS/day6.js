// -------------DAY 6-------------------
// Arrays

// Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Arrays
// Task 1: Create an array of numbers and log the first element.

// Task 2: Access the first and last elements of the array and log them to console.

// Activity 2: Array Methods(Basic):
// Task 1:  Use the push method to add a new number to the end of the array and log the updated array.

// Task 2: Use the pop method to remove the last number from the array and log the updated array.

// Task 3: Use the unshift method to add a new number to the beginning of the array and log the updated array.

// Task 4: Use the shift method to remove the first number from the array and log the updated array.

// Activity 3: Array Methods(Advanced):
// Task 1: Use the slice method to create a new array that contains the first 3 elements of the original array and log the new array.

// Task 2: Use the splice method to remove the last 2 elements of the original array and log the new array.

// Task 3: Use the concat method to create a new array that contains the original array and the new number, and log the new array.

// Task 4: Use the join method to create a string that contains the elements of the original array separated by commas and log the string.

// Task 5: Use the reverse method to reverse the order of the elements in the original array and log the new array.

// Task 6: Use the sort method to sort the original array in ascending and descending order and log the new array.

// Task 7: Use the filter method to create a new array that contains only the even numbers from the original array and log the new array.

// Task 8: Use the map method to create a new array that contains the square of each number in the original array and log the new array.

// Task 9: Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the original array and log the sum.

// Task 10: Use the reduce method to calculate the product of all the numbers in the original array and log the product.

// Activity 4: Array Iterations
// Task 1: Use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the array and log each element.

// Task 2: Use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the array in reverse order and log each element.

// Task 3: Use a while loop to iterate over the elements of the array and log each element.

// Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Arrays
// Task 1: Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) and log the entire array to the console.

// Task 2: Access and log a specific element from the two-dimensional array.

// Task 3: Use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the two-dimensional array and log each element.


// Feature Request:
// Array Manipulation Script: Write a script that demonstrates the creation of an array, adding and removing elements using push,pop,shift, unshift methods

// Array Transformation Script: Create a script that uses map, filter, reduce methods to transform and aggregate array data.

// Array Iteration Script: Write a script that iterates over an array using both , for loop and forEach method and logs each element.

// Two-dimensional Array Script: Create a script that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a two-dimensional array.

// achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// "Create and manipulate arrays using various methods."
// "Transform and aggregate array data using " map, filter, reduce
// "Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods."
// "Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays."
