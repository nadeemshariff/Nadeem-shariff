// Day 15: Closures

// Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Understanding Closures

// Task 1: Write a function returning another function accessing an outer function's variable. Log the result.
// Task 2: Create a closure for a private counter with increment and get functions.
// Activity 2: Practical Closures

// Task 3: Write a function generating unique IDs using a closure for the last ID.
// Task 4: Create a closure capturing a user's name and returning a greeting function.
// Activity 3: Closures in Loops

// Task 5: Write a loop creating an array of functions logging their index using closures.
// Activity 4: Module Pattern

// Task 6: Use closures for a simple item management module with add, remove, and list methods.
// Activity 5: Memoization

// Task 7: Write a function memoizing another function's results using a closure.
// Task 8: Create a memoized factorial function.
// Feature Request:

// Basic Closure Script: Demonstrate a basic closure with a function returning another function accessing the outer function's variable.
// Counter Closure Script: Create a script for a private counter with increment and get functions using a closure.
// Unique ID Generator Script: Write a script generating unique IDs using a closure for the last ID.
// Loop Closure Script: Demonstrate closures in loops to ensure correct index logging.
// Memoization Script: Memoize a function's results and demonstrate with a factorial calculation.
// Achievement:

// Understand and create closures in JavaScript.
// Use closures for private state and encapsulated modules.
// Apply closures in practical scenarios like unique IDs and memoization.
// Use closures in loops correctly.
